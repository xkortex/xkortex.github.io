It's #dockerdecember! Ok, I completely just made that up. I shall be putting together
a series of blogs covering all sorts of fun things I've learned (often the hard way)
about docker, containerization, and microservices.  

It's also going to likely be updated periodically in bits and pieces as I am mostly 
writing this while [waiting for images to build](https://xkcd.com/303/).
