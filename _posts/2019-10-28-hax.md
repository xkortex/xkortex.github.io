# docker network stack is a jerk
Was getting segfaults in a containerized camera driver. Could see the camera fine on the
network, and was using `network_mode: host` in compose.yml. Turns out in my project, 
I had a lingering `project_default` docker network. No idea why this was causing havoc, 
but `docker network rm project_default` fixed the problem. It's not the first time 
I have been bitten by docker network stack weirdness

# All executables passed to tini need to be exec'd
SIGTERM was not properly getting passed to aforementioned containerized ROS camera
driver. Tried adding `tini` to the stack, still no luck, even though my `entry.sh`
script used exec on the subsequent launcher script. Well, turns out *that* launcher 
script was calling `roslaunch`, which is a subprocess. Switching to `exec roslaunch foo:=bar`
solved the signal transmission and now getting clean teardown, woot!

Tini in general seems to help with init/teardown of processes.
